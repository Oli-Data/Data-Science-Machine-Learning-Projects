# üìÇ Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of **data science and machine learning projects** that showcase my work across exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and early-stage AI research.  
Each project highlights different aspects of the field, from working with structured datasets to experimenting with reasoning architectures.

## üìÅ Projects

### üè¶ [Bank Marketing ML](./Bank%20Marketing%20ML)  
Predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using machine learning models on a dataset of **41,188 records √ó 20 features**.  

- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, ANN  
- **Findings:** ANN achieved the highest accuracy/recall; Random Forest provided balanced performance; KNN underperformed due to dataset size.  
- **Skills:** Data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model training/evaluation, visualization

### üìä [Chicago Public Schools Analysis (2011‚Äì2012)](./Chicago%20Schools%20Project)  
Explores factors influencing academic performance across Chicago Public Schools (elementary & middle). Focused on cleaning, filtering, visualization, and correlation analysis.  

- **Findings:** Student attendance correlated strongly with academic performance (especially grades 3‚Äì8), while environment scores showed only weak correlations.  
- **Skills:** Data cleaning, visualization (ggplot2), correlation analysis, R Markdown reporting

### üß† [Project Gestalt](./Project%20Gestalt)  
An early-stage exploration into building AI systems that go beyond surface-level pattern recognition. Gestalt focuses on **reasoning, structure, and emergent behavior**, experimenting with how multiple models and frameworks can integrate.  

- **Vision:** Develop reasoning frameworks, integrate neural + symbolic methods, study emergent behavior.  
- **Current Focus:** Foundational experiments, small-scale reasoning prototypes, documenting insights.  
- **Skills:** AI research, Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, early-stage system design

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Across Projects
- **Languages:** Python, R  
- **ML/AI:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (planned), Random Forests, ANN  
- **Data Tools:** pandas, NumPy, dplyr, ggplot2  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2  
- **Workflow:** Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown, Google Colab

## üîÆ Next Steps
- Expand ML projects with hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and cross-validation.  
- Continue refining Project Gestalt as an experimental research initiative.  
- Add documentation and READMEs for additional homework/exploratory projects in progress.
