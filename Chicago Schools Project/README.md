## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Data Source:** [Chicago Public Schools â€“ Progress Report Cards 2011â€“2012](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t)  
- **Tools Used:** R, dplyr, ggplot2  
- **Focus:**  
  - Cleaning and transforming student performance data  
  - Filtering out incomplete/missing values (NDA fields, high schools omitted)  
  - Visualizing attendance and environment scores vs. grade-level performance  
  - Calculating correlations using Pearsonâ€™s formula

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Environment Scores** showed only weak correlations with student achievement.  
- **Student Attendance** had a much stronger relationship with academic success, especially in **grades 3â€“8**.
