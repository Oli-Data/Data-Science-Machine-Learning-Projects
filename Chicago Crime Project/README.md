# 🕵️ Chicago Crimes Analysis & Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the Chicago Crimes dataset to uncover patterns in criminal activity and build predictive models.  
The goal is twofold:  
1. Explore and visualize trends in crime across time, location, and type.  
2. Develop machine learning and deep learning models to predict crime outcomes, such as whether an arrest will occur or what type of crime is most likely given the circumstances.
