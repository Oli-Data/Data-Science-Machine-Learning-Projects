# 🧠 Project Gestalt

**Project Gestalt** is an early-stage exploration into building AI systems that go beyond surface-level pattern recognition.  
The project focuses on **reasoning, structure, and emergent behavior** — experimenting with how different models, techniques, and frameworks can combine into something greater than the sum of their parts.  

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
The goal of Gestalt is to experiment with:  
- **Reasoning Frameworks** → Exploring architectures that simulate logical, step-based thought.  
- **Integration of Multiple Models** → Combining different approaches (symbolic, neural, statistical) into a cohesive system.  
- **Emergent Behavior** → Investigating how complex intelligence arises from simple rules and structures.

## 🚧 Current Status
This project is still in its **early research and prototyping phase**.  
Right now, the focus is on:  
- Setting up foundational experiments  
- Testing small-scale implementations of reasoning steps  
- Documenting insights and potential directions  

---

## ⚙️ Planned Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.x**  
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experiments)  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (model prototyping)  
- NumPy, pandas (data manipulation)  
- (Future) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), symbolic logic libraries, or custom frameworks  

---

## 📌 Roadmap
- [ ] Define a minimal reasoning pipeline prototype  
- [ ] Run baseline experiments on structured tasks (e.g., logic puzzles, symbolic math)  
- [ ] Explore integration of neural + symbolic methods  
- [ ] Document learnings and iterate

## 🤝 Notes
This project is exploratory — it may evolve significantly over time.  
For now, the priority is **experimentation, learning, and building a foundation** for more advanced AI systems.
