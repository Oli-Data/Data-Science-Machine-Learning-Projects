# 🏦 Portuguese Bank Marketing – Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes the **Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.  
It applies different machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and identifies key features that influence client decisions.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository – [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)  
- **Shape:** ~41,000 rows × 20 columns  
- **Target Variable (`y`):** Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling for numerical columns
2. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-score

## 📈 Results
- Logistic Regression performed well as a baseline model.  
- Random Forest showed strong overall performance with good balance of precision and recall.  
- KNN was less effective due to dataset size and dimensionality.  
- ANN achieved the highest accuracy but required more computation.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, NumPy (data handling)  
- scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)
